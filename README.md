### Ginga CC WebServices

This project is a partial implementation of Ginga CC WebServices for the TV 3.0
Project. It was created as part of UFJF developments for the validation of APIs
and architecture for a decoupled player supporting MPEG-H immersive audio and 
other media formats.

Ginga CC WebServices APIs are specified in ABNT NBR 15606-11. However, only 
APIs applicable to TV 3.0 use cases are included in this project.

Initial files structure and source code created from [Node Express GitLab template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/express).
